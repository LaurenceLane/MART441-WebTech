This week I was mostly trying to dust off my html coding knowledge, thankfully I had worked on some over the summer, so I wasn't trying to remember something I hadn't used in a year.
While I don't typically enjoy using js, I ended up using it for two sections, once for my portfolio tab using an open source script to create the little boxes that pop up, and again 
to create the randomly chosen quote on the "me" tab.
I used some assets from when I created my site in the Web Design class since I already had them on hand and all coheasive.
