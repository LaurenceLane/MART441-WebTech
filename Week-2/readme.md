
Mine was a lot more personalized and in-depth, but that's likely due to only giving bare bones instructions. 
I would hate it if I only used the AI output, I don't learn anything from it and it isn't mine. It's like asking another person to do it
for you, if you made small edits after they gave it, it'd still be their work you're using. I'm not learning how or why parts of the code work 
and so much of coding is using the starting blocks to build into other things. So skipping that to use AI feels like self-sabotage.
