I had fun with this assignment once I was able to figure it out in my head.
I'm a visual learner, and for coding that usually means being able to see how a project looks and functions and working backwards from there rather than following instructions step-by-step. So the examples you include are extremely helpful. My barebones expeirence with javascript on my own time helped bridge things together. I did have trouble finding a good stopping point with writing though, I kept having to stop myself from going overboard and writing more story than what would make sense for this assignment.
